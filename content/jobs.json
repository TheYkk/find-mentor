Born in Antalya, Turkey on 27 May 2020, established in Tallinn, Estonia on 26.11.2020 as a private limited company; Bytelus OÜ.\n\nBytelus born after Radiolize’s success, which became a global cloud SaaS that operates in digital audio streaming. Since we had more crazy ideas and strived to do more, instead of creating a conventional company called Radiolize, we created a roof company for our projects. The name comes from “Byte” and “Zeus” which also reminds us the lovely place Olympos in Antalya / Turkey. Also, that’s why we call our offices “Home of the Zeus of Bytes”.\n\nWe are trying to do revolutionary disruptive things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about. We know how hard it is, that’s why our motto is “ad astra per aspera”, which is a popular Latin phrase meaning “a rough road leads to the stars.”\n\nAbout Radiolize:\n\nRadiolize.com is a growing venture of Bytelus Labs. It's a SaaS (Software as a service) that people can create, run and manage their own online radio stations. In the market since July 2019.\n\nRadiolize provides all-in-one modern digital solutions for online audio broadcasting. Users can manage and broadcast their online radios and on-demand audio files from anywhere, anytime, any device. It's based on cloud technology.
